    <blockquote cite="https://www.thecityschoolsharjah.ae/">The true philosophy of The City School is reflected in our
        motto, “I Am To Learn”. When our students move on to higher education, we expect them to have gained an
        enthusiastic and lasting interest in learning, and to have recognised that there are always new things to
        discover.The world of work and life in general are today more competitive than they have ever been and we want
        our students to have the confidence, independence, and intellectual ability to apply what they learn in the
        classrooms to life. We believe that when young people are empowered and facilitated, they rise above
        expectations.The broader aspirations shared by our faculty and staff include giving every opportunity to
        students to develop into well-rounded individuals. We know how important it is to create ideal academic and
        social environments that allow them to flourish and to acquire the skills and attributes that will enable them
        to make valued contributions to society
