    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur">Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the
        clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic
        period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of
        dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
        Triassic–Jurassic
        extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The
        fossil
        record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic
        epoch,
        and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately
        66 mya.
        Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all
        dinosaurs other than birds.</blockquote>
